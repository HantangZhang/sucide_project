把数据分为两类，discovery cohert and test cohert
统计每类有多少数据
对每种方法进行：
lr，svm，random forest， xgboost，dnn，native Bayes (NB)
1. 选择合适的调参方法，进行挑参we train and tune hyper parameters
2. 对两类数据统计他们的
Accuracy：预测对的当中，真的是对的
Precision
Recall
F1 score
AUROC

data processing issues：
1. column 'CFI-S.PheneVisit' data type is string, i am not clear its internal meaning and how to convert to float data type
2. after 1 Psychiatric, data has some missing value

divide into 2 categories
Category 1: High Risk

Those with suicidal ideation (having thoughts of suicide) and those with a suicide plan (having a plan to carry out suicide) can be grouped into a high-risk category as they are actively considering and planning suicide.

Category 2: Past Attempts/ Hospitalizations

Those with a history of suicide attempt(s) and those with hospitalization(s) for suicidality can be grouped into a second category as they have a history of suicidal behavior but are not currently at an elevated risk of suicide.
'''


data processing：
1. divide data to 2 categories, one is binary, another one is 0-3(original)
2. after coulum '1 Psychiatric', data has some missing places, so i only selected the columns before this column as features


Training todo:
1. deciding the most important evaluation metrics. （done）

Logistic Regresion:
1. deciding the best parameter currently, record the evaluation metrics
